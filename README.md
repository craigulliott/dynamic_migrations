## Installation

Install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install dynamic_migrations

Create your new platform:

    $ dynamic_migrations create my_platform_name

Note, this gem depends on the postgres gem `pg`, which depends on the `libpq` package. On Apple Silicon you can run the following commands before installation to prepare your system.

```
# required for pg gem on apple silicon
brew install libpq
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/libpq/bin:$PATH"
```

## Getting Started

Todo


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

We use [Conventional Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13).

Code should be linted and formatted according to [Ruby Standard](https://github.com/standardrb/standard).

Publishing is automated via github actions and Googles [Release Please](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action) github action

We prefer using squash-merges when merging pull requests because it helps keep a linear git history and allows more fine grained control of commit messages which get sent to release-please and ultimately show up in the changelog.

Type checking is enabled for this project. You can find the corresponding `rbs` files in the sig folder.

Install types for the packages used in development (such as `rspec`) by running

    $ rbs collection install
